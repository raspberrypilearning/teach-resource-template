# Resource Name Lesson Plan 1 - Lesson Name

This workshop will introduce students to using Scratch to interface with the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi

As well as your Raspberry Pi you will need:

| Equipment | Image |
| --- | ---|
| 1 x Breadboard | ![Breadboard](images/breadboard.png) |
| 8 x Jumper Wires (male to female) | ![Jumper Wires](images/jumper_wires.png) |
| 3 LEDs | ![LED](images/led.png) |
| 3 x 330 ohm resistor | ![330ohm Resistor](images/330_resistor.png) |
| 1 Push Button | ![Push Button](images/push_button.png) |


## Learning objectives

- To understand how to use Scratch to control the outputs of the GPIO pins
- To understand how to use Scratch to receive input from the GPIO pins

## Learning outcomes

### All students are able to

- Use Scratch GPIO to control the output of an LED
- Use Scrtach GPIO to receive input from a button push

### Most students are able to

- Use multiple outputs to control a sequence of LEDs
- Use multiple inputs to control the movement of a sprite

### Some students are able to

- Use a buttons or buttons to incluence the output from LEDs

## Lesson Summary

The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features, one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput pins or GPIO. These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices from lights and motors to buttons and sensors. The Raspberry Pi 2 has 40 GPIO pins, whilst the original Raspberry Pi only has 26, this workshop will work for either model.
